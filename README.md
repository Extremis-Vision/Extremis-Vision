Hi there! 👋 I’m currently in my second year of engineering school and super passionate about all things tech. While I’m not quite at the skill level I’m aiming for yet, I’ve worked on some cool projects that you might find interesting.

One of my favorites is Jarvis, a voice assistant that can answer anything you’d typically ask Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant. I’ve also built a remote-controlled tank, a shrimp food dispenser, and more – ranging from fun side projects to more ambitious builds.

Many of these projects (like Jarvis) are designed to run on a server or computer using Docker, where I also host services like my own cloud storage, a personal finance tracker, and other custom solutions. I enjoy using existing examples for inspiration and always make an effort to credit sources. Feel free to check out my projects, and don’t hesitate to let me know if you spot any issues or have suggestions! 🚀

My Passions:
3D Printing 🖨️ – Designing and printing functional or fun items.
Electronics ⚡ – Working with circuits and hardware to bring projects to life.
3D Modeling 🎨 – Creating models for printing or design purposes.
Programming 💻 – Coding everything from simple scripts to more complex systems.
Testing New Tech 🔍 – Experimenting with new tools and technologies to stay ahead.
Woodworking 🪵 – Crafting and building with wood for custom solutions or creative projects.
Metal Soldering 🔧 – Working with metals and soldering to assemble or repair parts.
Forging 🔨 – Shaping and creating custom metalwork using traditional and modern forging techniques.
